                    <h2>Using Configurations in Smoothflow Activities</h2>
                    <p>This document explains how to use configuration files on Smoothflow. Please follow the instructions in
                        the proper order to successfully perform the operations.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you wish to use values which can change overtime you can include them in the configuration section.
                        This will allow you to change values in a file generated when the workflow is running for the first
                        time. You could change the values as you need without having to rebuild the workflow again. For example
                        you can use this for is URLs. Over time the service locations might change. Therefore, it is better
                        to have those values on a config file which can be modified later.</p>

                    <h4>Using Configuration on the Smoothflow App</h4>

                    <p>To add configuration:</p>
                    <p><b>1.  On the bottom right corner, click</b> <img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/con_window_icon.png"
                        /> <b>. The Configurations window opens.</b></p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p><b>2.  Enter the KEY and VALUE.</b></p>
                    <p><b>3.  Select the Category (configuration in this case).</b></p>
                    <p><b>4.  Click ADD. The entry will be added and displayed in the list.</b></p>

                    </br>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <h4>Using values on configuration file on your custom activities</h4>

                    <p>When you have a configuration file, it makes it easier for the developer to update or change constant
                        values after the workflows has been built. Smoothflow development team has created a set of methods
                        which developers can use to access these configuration features.</p>

                    <p>First of all you need to import the "Common" package to use this feature on your custom activity.</p>

                    <p><b>Importing the common package</b></br>
                        import "processengine/Common"</p>
                    <p>Once imported you could get a specific value by passing the KEY as an argument to the "GetConfigValue"
                        method. It will return you a string value which is the value you are referring to.</p>

                    <p><b>Get Config Value</b></br>
                        <i>authURL := Common.GetConfigValue("authURL");</i></p>

                    <p>If you need the entire configurations, use the following method.</p>

                    <p><b>Get Config</b></br>
                        <i>config := Common.GetConfigValue();</i></p>

                    <p>If you have any new keys or need to update or save the edited configurations you can use the following
                        method.</p>

                    <p><b>Saving the config</b></br>
                        <i>Common.SaveConfig(map[string]string);</i></p>

                    <p>Please make sure you follow the guidelines to use the workflow in an optimal level.
                    </p>


                    <h4>Using configurations when the workflow is built or on client side</h4>
                    <p>Once you have successfully downloaded the built workflow, you will get one executable file. When the
                        workflow is running for the first time it will check whether the supporting configuration files are
                        already existing. If not it will generate the actual configuration file with default values in it.
                        The file will be saved in the same directory where the running workflow is currently saved. If the
                        workflow is moved to a different directory the configuration file will again be generated with the
                        default values.
                    </p>

                    <p>As displayed in the above figure, only the executable will be downloaded from the Smoothflow server.
                        The "Logs", "agent.config" and "settings.config" are generated automatically by the executable. All
                        the configurations you have used when designing the workflow will be available on this configuration
                        file. A sample configuration file will contain the standard JSON structure which is easy to maintain
                        and edit.</p>

                    <p>All you need to do is to edit the values for the KEYs and replace them with the correct details.</p>
