                    <h2>Getting started with SmoothFlow</h2>
                    <p>If you have a set of tasks that can be reused, and you need a way to streamline those tasks and get something done, Smoothflow might just be what you were looking for. It is a user friendly and convenient Workflow designing tool for everyday use. If you are a developer who is familiar with the Go Programming Language, then you can write your own units of tasks which we call with a fancy name “Activity”.
</p>

                    <p>Smoothflow packs a variety of built-in services and also supports most popular services. It has an awesome collection of activities or Atomic Worker units that can be used to save data to your database of choice, Social Media Services, File System Operations, Custom Web Requesters, handling SMS and Emails and even IoT compatibility with Raspberry Pi and Amazon Alexa. It supports a wide range of databases including Microsoft SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Google BigTable and Google CloudDataStore.</p>

                    <p>You can sign up for a free account and get started without own Tenant (A space where your accounts live.). If you think Smoothflow suits your requirement, then you can upgrade to a premium package as you grow. Premium packages will ensure that you can create a larger number of workflows and add more users to your tenant. You can add users of other tenants as well and it depends on the maximum number of users you can have.</p>

                    <p>Now let’s get started on creating your first workflow</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_1.png"></p>
                    <p>First go to SmoothFlow website, if you’re reading this you already know that. Then click on Try Free to create a free account.
</p>
                    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_2.png"></p>
                    <p>Next enter your Name, Email Address, Password and a Domain name for your Company/Tenant. If you are an individual user, feel free to use anything of your choice.
</p>
                    <p>After the completion you will get a verification Email to the provided Email Address. Click the verification link and your account will be verified. Now you can log in to Smoothflow with your new account. There you will be asked to choose a package for your tenant.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_3.png"></p>
                    <p>Since this is your first step in getting started, you may choose the Free plan. But if you feel adventurous you can go Big too as well. After selecting a package, you will be shown the main dashboard of Smoothflow. If you have an existing Gravatar account set up for your provided Email Address, you will have your avatar automatically synced. If you need to set a new profile picture, you can change the Gravatar avatar and you are all set, or you can select a picture from Profile Settings. If you click on your picture in the left pane, you will be redirected to the profile screen where you can define avatar sources and set up billing and security credentials options. These will be elaborated in a separate blog post as the scope of this post is to get you started in Smoothflow as swiftly as possible.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_4.png"></p>
                    <p>The image above shows the dashboard of a Smoothflow account. On the left you have the Menu Pane and we will be explaining that below. On the right you have Recently Opened, Downloaded and Recently Built workflows. The Built workflows section displays the workflows which are downloaded as executables or hosted on Smoothflow.</p>
                    <p>Let’s explore the right pane first. </p>
                    <p>There you have access to the features and functions of Smoothflow. There are two main screens in Smoothflow. One is the Drawboard and the other is Menu Screen. If you click on the top left Smoothflow logo you will be switched to the drawboard and if you click on it again you will return to this menu screen with the dashboard. Let’s see what these options are.
</p>

                    <p><b>Open</b> - This will open all the saved workflows and their versions. You can make changes and save
                        them as different versions of the same workflow.</p>
                    <p><b>Import & Export</b> - Export allows you to save work flows as files and share them with other peers
                        who use Smoothflow. Import function can be used to open those external files and import workflow
                        data to your draw board.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Build Executable</b> - This enables to build an executable file for Windows, Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD
                        or Raspberry Pi platforms. After building the executable you can either download the exe file or
                        just let Smoothflow to host it in a docker inside the Smoothflow server itself. You don’t have to
                        worry about the maintenance of docker servers since Smoothflow will automatically manage that.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_5.png"></p>
                    <p><b>Published Dockers</b> - In the earlier step if you save the workflow in a docker, then you will see
                        the list of docker processors running.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_6.png"></p>
                    <p>If you click on one of the workflows, you can view the detailed information about that specific workflow
                        instance including the number of incoming and outgoing requests. You can also invoke URLs if you
                        require to do so.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_7.png"></p>
                    <p><b>Devices</b> - You can register your computer devices or IoT devices like Raspberry Pi as a device
                        in Smoothflow and then push your workflows to it so that those workflows will be hosted inside the
                        device with a single click. This feature will be discussed in detail in a separate blog post.</p>
                    <p><b>Users</b> - This section contains a list of all the members under your tenant. You can also invite
                        other people to join Smoothflow under your tenant.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_8.png"></p>
                    <p><b>Settings</b> – Here you can configure your Draw board and themes in Smoothflow. You can change colors
                        and accents, zooming and panning. You can also restrict what kind of controls should be displayed
                        in the Draw board so it will be less cluttered if you have too many activities available. There is
                        too much information to explain in a startup post like this. Everything in depth about the listed
                        features will be discussed in the upcoming posts.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_9.png"></p>
                    <p>Since all important bits are covered, let’s head to draw board where you can actually design your workflows.
                        Click on top left Smoothflow icon to begin.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_10.png"></p>
                    <p>The above image shows the drawing board. First icon in the toolbar presents you with the activity controls
                        to begin with. As a rule, you should always start with a Start node and Stop node. In the middle
                        you design the flow control. Under “Flow Controls” you can find the Start and Stop nodes. There are
                        lots of nodes to choose from, but let’s try to print a message in your first ever work flow. For
                        that drag and drop a “Message” control. Then connect the hook points by dragging and connecting with
                        the other nodes. First connect Start node and Message node and then connect Message node and Stop
                        node. Click on Message control, a properties pane will be displayed on the right side. Finally enter
                        your message inside MessageBody section.</p>
                    <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_11.png"></p>
                    <p>That’s about it. You have successfully drawn your first workflow. Now Click on the Save icon in the toolbar.
                        This will bring you another screen requesting workflow details such as name, description, version
                        and a comment. Fill them according to your requirement. Now you should be able to see the newly created
                        workflow in the Open section in Dashboard. In a separate post we will see how to host them, deploy
                        and test them.</p>
