                                                <h2>Using Configurations in Smoothflow Activities</h2>
                                                <p>This document explains how to use configuration files on Smoothflow. Please
                                                    follow the instructions in the proper order to successfully perform the
                                                    operations.</p>

                                                <p>If you wish to use values which can change overtime you can include them
                                                    in the configuration section. This will allow you to change values in
                                                    a file generated when the workflow is running for the first time. You
                                                    could change the values as you need without having to rebuild the workflow
                                                    again. For example you can use this for is URLs. Over time the service
                                                    locations might change. Therefore, it is better to have those values
                                                    on a config file which can be modified later.</p>

                                                <h4>Using Configuration on the Smoothflow App</h4>

                                                <p>To add configuration:</p>

                                                <h4>Using values on configuration file on your custom activities</h4>

                                                <p>When you have a configuration file, it makes it easier for the developer
                                                    to update or change constant values after the workflows has been built.
                                                    Smoothflow development team has created a set of methods which developers
                                                    can use to access these configuration features.</p>

                                                <p>First of all you need to import the "Common" package to use this feature
                                                    on your custom activity.</p>

                                                <p><b>Importing the common package</b></br>
                                                    import "processengine/Common"</p>
                                                <p>Once imported you could get a specific value by passing the KEY as an argument
                                                    to the "GetConfigValue" method. It will return you a string value which
                                                    is the value you are referring to.</p>

                                                <p><b>Get Config Value</b></br>
                                                    <i>authURL := Common.GetConfigValue("authURL");</i></p>

                                                <p>If you need the entire configurations, use the following method.</p>

                                                <p><b>Get Config</b></br>
                                                    <i>config := Common.GetConfigValue();</i></p>

                                                <p>If you have any new keys or need to update or save the edited configurations
                                                    you can use the following method.</p>

                                                <p><b>Saving the config</b></br>
                                                    <i>Common.SaveConfig(map[string]string);</i></p>

                                                <p>Please make sure you follow the guidelines to use the workflow in an optimal
                                                    level.</p>


                                                <h4>Using configurations when the workflow is built or on client side</h4>
                                                <p>Once you have successfully downloaded the built workflow, you will get one
                                                    executable file. When the workflow is running for the first time it will
                                                    check whether the supporting configuration files are already existing.
                                                    If not it will generate the actual configuration file with default values
                                                    in it. The file will be saved in the same directory where the running
                                                    workflow is currently saved. If the workflow is moved to a different
                                                    directory the configuration file will again be generated with the default
                                                    values.</p>

                                                <p>As displayed in the above figure, only the executable will be downloaded
                                                    from the Smoothflow server. The "Logs", "agent.config" and "settings.config"
                                                    are generated automatically by the executable. All the configurations
                                                    you have used when designing the workflow will be available on this configuration
                                                    file. A sample configuration file will contain the standard JSON structure
                                                    which is easy to maintain and edit.</p>

                                                <p>All you need to do is to edit the values for the KEYs and replace them with
                                                    the correct details.</p>

                                <p>If you have a set of tasks which can be reused, and you need a way to line up those tasks
                                    and get something done, Smoothflow might just be what you were searching for. It is a
                                    user friendly and convenient workflow designing tool for everyday use. If you are a developer
                                    who is familiar with Go Programming Language, then you can write your own units of tasks
                                    which we call with a fancy name “Activity”.</p>

                                <p>Smoothflow packs a variety of built-in services and also supports the most popular services.
                                    It has an awesome collection of activities or atomic worker units that can be used to
                                    save data to your database of choice, Social Media Services, File System Operations,
                                    Custom Web Requesters, handling SMS and Emails and even IoT compatibility with Raspberry
                                    Pi and Amazon Alexa. It supports a wide range of databases including Microsoft SQL, MySQL,
                                    PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Google BigTable and Google CloudDataStore.</p>

                                <p>You can sign up for a free account and get started. If you think Smoothflow suits your requirements,
                                    then you can upgrade for a premium package as you grow. Premium packages will ensure
                                    that you can create more number of workflows and add more users to your tenant. You can
                                    add users of other tenants as well and it depends on the maximum number of users you
                                    can have.</p>

                                <p>Now let’s get started on creating your first workflow</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_1.png"></p>
                                <p>First go to SmoothFlow website, if you reading this you already know that. Then click on
                                    Try Free to create a free account. </p>
                                <p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_2.png"></p>
                                <p>Next enter your Name, Email Address, password and a domain name for your company/tenancy.
                                    If you are an individual user feel free to use anything of your choice.</p>
                                <p>After the completion you will get a verification Email to the provided Email Address. Click
                                    the verification link and your account will be verified. Now you can log in to Smoothflow
                                    with your new account. There you will be asked to choose a package for your tenant. </p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_3.png"></p>
                                <p>Since this is your first step of getting started, you may choose the Free plan. But if you
                                    feel adventurous you can go big too as you will. After selecting the package, you will
                                    be displayed with the main dashboard of Smoothflow. If you have an existing Gravatar
                                    account set up for your provided Email Address, you will have your avatar automatically
                                    synced. If you need to set a new profile picture, you can change the Gravatar avatar
                                    and you are all set or you can select a picture from inside the profile settings. If
                                    you click on your picture in left pane, you will be redirected to profile screen where
                                    you can define avatar sources and set up billing and security credentials options. These
                                    will be elaborated in a separate blog post and won’t be focused here since the scope
                                    of this post is to get you started in Smoothflow as simple as possible.</p>

                                    Menu Pane and we will be explaining that below. On the right side you have recently opened
                                    workflows, downloaded flows and recently built flows. Built workflows section displays
                                    the workflows which are downloaded as executables or hosted on Smoothflow. </p>
                                <p>Let’s explore the right pane first. There you have the access to the features and functions
                                    of Smoothflow. There are 2 main screens in Smoothflow. One is the draw board and the
                                    other is Menu Screen. If you click on top left Smoothflow logo you will be switched to
                                    the draw board and if you click on it again you will come back to this menu screen with
                                    dashboard. Let’s see what these options are.</p>

                                <p><b>Open</b> - This will open all the saved workflows and their versions. You can make changes
                                    and save them as different versions of the same workflow.</p>
                                <p><b>Import & Export</b> - Export allows you to save work flows as files and share them with
                                    other peers who use Smoothflow. Import function can be used to open those external files
                                    and import workflow data to your draw board.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>Build Executable</b> - This enables to build an executable file for Windows, Linux, Mac
                                    OS, FreeBSD or Raspberry Pi platforms. After building the executable you can either download
                                    the exe file or just let Smoothflow to host it in a docker inside the Smoothflow server
                                    itself. You don’t have to worry about the maintenance of docker servers since Smoothflow
                                    will automatically manage that.</p>

                                <p><b>Published Dockers</b> - In the earlier step if you save the workflow in a docker, then
                                    you will see the list of docker processors running.</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_6.png"></p>
                                <p>If you click on one of the workflows, you can view the detailed information about that specific
                                    workflow instance including the number of incoming and outgoing requests. You can also
                                    invoke URLs if you require to do so.</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_7.png"></p>
                                <p><b>Devices</b> - You can register your computer devices or IoT devices like Raspberry Pi
                                    as a device in Smoothflow and then push your workflows to it so that those workflows
                                    will be hosted inside the device with a single click. This feature will be discussed
                                    in detail in a separate blog post.</p>
                                <p><b>Users</b> - This section contains a list of all the members under your tenant. You can
                                    also invite other people to join Smoothflow under your tenant.</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_8.png"></p>
                                <p><b>Settings</b> – Here you can configure your Draw board and themes in Smoothflow. You can
                                    change colors and accents, zooming and panning. You can also restrict what kind of controls
                                    should be displayed in the Draw board so it will be less cluttered if you have too many
                                    activities available. There is too much information to explain in a startup post like
                                    this. Everything in depth about the listed features will be discussed in the upcoming
                                    posts.</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_9.png"></p>
                                <p>Since all important bits are covered, let’s head to draw board where you can actually design
                                    your workflows. Click on top left Smoothflow icon to begin.</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_10.png"></p>
                                <p>The above image shows the drawing board. First icon in the toolbar presents you with the
                                    activity controls to begin with. As a rule, you should always start with a Start node
                                    and Stop node. In the middle you design the flow control. Under “Flow Controls” you can
                                    find the Start and Stop nodes. There are lots of nodes to choose from, but let’s try
                                    to print a message in your first ever work flow. For that drag and drop a “Message” control.
                                    Then connect the hook points by dragging and connecting with the other nodes. First connect
                                    Start node and Message node and then connect Message node and Stop node. Click on Message
                                    control, a properties pane will be displayed on the right side. Finally enter your message
                                    inside MessageBody section.</p>
                                <p><img src="http://www.smoothflow.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gettings_start_11.png"></p>
                                <p>That’s about it. You have successfully drawn your first workflow. Now Click on the Save icon
                                    in the toolbar. This will bring you another screen requesting workflow details such as
                                    name, description, version and a comment. Fill them according to your requirement. Now
                                    you should be able to see the newly created workflow in the Open section in Dashboard.
                                    In a separate post we will see how to host them, deploy and test them.</p>
